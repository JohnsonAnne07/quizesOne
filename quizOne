JSDoc comment
This is a multiline comment that the complier skips.
Everything within this JSDoc is used to give information to the next coder.
This one contains things like author name and contact, version number,
a brief summery of the code, and a to do list.
This line ends the comment.

This is a pragma that makes the complier less forgiving to mistakes.
This imports a library called "readline sync" that allows the code to use the data that the user inputs.

This declares a global variable called continueResponse. It's on its own line because it uses boolean logic.
This declares global variables called currentMonth, currentGrade, currentClassroom, upperTuition. These are all numerics.
This declares the constant 'max grade' and assigns in the value 8. This, and all the following constants, are used to illiminate magic numbers.
This declares the constant 'max month' and assigns in the value 9.
This declares the constant 'max classroom' and assigns in the value 3.
This declares the constant 'kindergarten tuition' and assigns in the value 80.

This is the dispatcher method - called "main" function
This clears the screen, then there is a single line comment that is ignored by the complier
This calls the setContinueResponse method
This starts a while loop that says: while continueResponse is one, the following lines happen.
This calls the method 'setCurrentMonth'
This calls the method 'setCurrentGrade'
This calls the method 'setCurrentClassroom'
This calls the method 'processPaymentCoupons'
This calls the method 'setContinueResponse'
This starts a 'for' loop that sets i equal to 0, tests if i is less than the constant 'max classroom', and if i is less than max classroom, it calls the 'printGoodbye' method. Then it adds one to i. If i isn't less that printGoodbye, then it breaks out of the 'for' loop.
This is the actual call to the method 'printGoodbye'
This ends to for loop.
This ends the while loop.
This ends the 'main' function, or the dispatcher method.

This is the call to the dispatcher - or main - method.

This is the setContinueResponse function
This is an 'if' loop that says if continueResponse is null (has nothing in it, first time the program runs) the following happens. If continueResponse isn't null, it skips to like 38
This assigns -1 to continueResponse.
This starts a while loop that says when continueResponse doesn't equal 1 or 0, the following happens. If it does equal 1 or 0, it breaks out of the while loop and skips to 41
This displays the question 'Do you want to..." and assigns the answer to continueResponse
This closes the while loop
This closes the if loop, and starts the else loop that says if continueResponse doesn't not equal 0 or 1 (so if it equals 0 or 1), do the following
This assigns 1 to continueResponse
This closes the else loop
This closes the setContinueResponse function

this is the setCurrentMonth function
This starts an if bloack that says if currentMonth doesn't equal null and is less than or equal to the constant 'max month' the following line happens
This adds one to currentMonth
This ends the if loop and starts an else loop
This sets the currentMonth equal to 0 (basically, this happens only on the first time through the code)
This ends the else loop
This ends the setCurrentMonth function

This is the function setCurrentGrade
This starts an if loop that says if currentGrade is not undefined (or null) and it's less than or equal to the constant 'max grade', the following happens
This adds one to currentGrade
This ends the if block and starts an else block
This sets currentGrade equal to 0 (this only happens the first time through)
This ends the else loop
This ends the setCurrentGrade function

This is the function setCurrentClassroom
This starts an if loop that says if currentClassroom is not undefined (or null) and it's less than or equal to the constant 'max classroom', the following happens
This adds one to currentClassroom
This ends the if block and starts an else block
This sets currentClassroom equal to 1 (this only happens the first time through)
This ends the else loop
This ends the setCurrentClassroom function

This is the function setUpperTuition
This sets a local constant 'base tuition' and assigns 60 to it
This sets upperTuition equal to the constant 'base tuition' multiplied by the variable currentGrade
This closes the function setUpperTuition

This is the function processPaymentCoupons
This starts a while loop that says while currentGrade is less than the constant 'max grade', the following happens
This starts a while loop that says while currentClassroom is less than the constant 'max classroom', the following happens
This starts a while loop that says while currentMonth is less than the constant 'max month', the following happens
This starts an if loop that says the following happens if currentGrade is equal to 0, and it doesn't test for number type
This prints the phrase 'the tuition for month (current month variable), for classroom (current classroom variable), of grade (current grade variable) is (kindergarten tuition constant).' and it prints it on a new line, tabbed in.
This closes the if loop and starts an else loop
This calls the setUpperTuition function
This prints the phrase 'the tuition for month (current month variable), for classroom (current classroom variable), of grade (current grade variable) is (upper tuition variable).' and it prints it on a new line, tabbed in.
This closes the else loop
This calls the setCurrentMonth function
This closes the 'currentMonth' while loop
This calls the setCurrentClassroom function
This calls the setCurrentMonth function
This closes the currentClassroom while loop
This calls setCurrentGrade
This calls setCurrentClassroom
This closes the currentGrade while loop
This closes the processPaymentCoupons function

This is the printGoodbye function
This prints 'Goodbye.' tabbed over to the screen.
This closes the printGoodbye function
